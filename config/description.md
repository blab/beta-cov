This phylogeny shows betacoronavirus (beta-CoV) diversity sampled from [Genbank via ViPR](https://www.viprbrc.org/brc/vipr_genome_search.spg?method=ShowCleanSearch&decorator=corona). These ~500 sequences are randomly selected out of a pool of ~1400 available sequences with more than 5000 bases.

The Wuhan coronavirus sample is named **WH-Human_1** (colored red, [click here to highlight](/coronavirus?s=WH-Human_1)) and groups with SARS-related bat coronaviruses (colored orange). The Wuhan sample nests with sampled SARS-related bat coronaviruses, but this does not mean there was a direct bat-to-human spillover event.

The Wuhan coronavirus genome was generously shared by Professor Yong-Zhen Zhang and colleagues via this [post on virological.org](http://virological.org/t/initial-genome-release-of-novel-coronavirus/319). They make the request: "Please feel free to download, share, use, and analyze this data. We ask that you communicate with us if you wish to publish results that use these data in a journal." We gratefully acknowledgement their contribution.

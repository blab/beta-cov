This is a one-off [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org) build for betacoronavirus, visible at
[nextstrain.org/groups/blab/beta-cov](https://nextstrain.org/groups/blab/beta-cov).

All data to reproduce the build is housed in this repository. The entire build can be regenerated by cloning the repository and running
```
snakemake -p
```
with a [local Nextstrain installation](https://nextstrain.org/docs/getting-started/local-installation) or by running
```
nextstrain build .
```
with a [containerized Nextstrain installation](https://nextstrain.org/docs/getting-started/container-installation).

The resulting output JSON at `auspice/beta-cov.json` can be visualized by running `auspice view --datasetDir auspice` or `nextstrain view auspice/` depending on local vs containerized installation.
